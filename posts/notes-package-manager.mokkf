Package manager:
  - Install
  - Remove
  - Upgrade

Install:
  1. Attempt to get list of dependencies
    a. Outcome one: No dependencies (continue)
    b. Outcome two: Impossible situation (error)
    c. Outcome three: Dependency list satisfied (continue)
  - It appears using a SAT solver would be best. Only one problem â€¦ I can't understand how to use it or what exactly one does.
    - Articles I've looked at:
      1. [https://research.swtch.com/version-sat](https://research.swtch.com/version-sat)
  2. Decide order of dependency installation
    - Some can be installed in parallel
    - It appears the best algorithm for this would be a topological sort? Not sure what that is yet
  3. Done!
Thing to consider: Hooks? Here's [an article](https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2019-07-20-hooks-and-triggers/) on the subject.
