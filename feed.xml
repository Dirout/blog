Kathleen, a waifish yet perfectly kempt woman of 32, kept a household that was the envy of all the other home-bound wives on the street.&LT/p> &LTp>Bradley, a successful lawyer in their moderately-sized, up-and-coming city, was a very proud man, both of his sparkling new home in the suburbs, and of his much sought-after position at his firm. Indeed, they were a jewel in the crown of the American upper-middle class.&LT/p> &LTp>However, Kathleen had a secret: a mouse breeding business down in the basement—and not &LTem>just&LT/em> in the sense of breeding mice. It was not like the love that was expected of a woman of her status, approaching middle age. No, this love was something more passionate, scandalous, and fiery than what this old maid was expected to get from Bradley— for how could a man compare to a well-bred mouse?&LT/p> &LTp>At first, Bradley and Kathleen had been like most other young couples in their generation: brought together by a baseline level of regard, convenient circumstances, and, on the part of Bradley, at least, an average amount of attraction. Alas, as time went on, the unremarkable circumstances upon which their relationship was founded began to deteriorate—or, rather, crumble.&LT/p> &LTp>When, for the millionth time, Bradley came home with ‘exciting news’ regarding his job status, a ‘blow to those rat-race millions’, Kathleen realized that her life brought her no joy, as it brought her no purpose or progress. She needed an investment, a passion, and true companionship. What then, she thought, could be better than a mouse? Short, sweet, adorable and furry, their squeaks could make Bradley’s sweaty, intrusive hands bearable most nights.&LT/p> &LTp>Thus, one sunny morning, after Bradley had just stomped his way over her freshly vacuumed carpet and out of the house with hardly a, “See ya later, sweet-cheeks,” to the woman who did most everything for him, Kathleen had an idea: she would finally get those mice she’d been yearning for.&LT/p> &LTp>She ran out the door with a smile on her face and went down to ‘Clompin’ Clive’s Curious Creatures’ and picked out some bright white mice, with red in their eyes. She named the girls ‘Lucy’, ‘Liza’, and ‘Lexapro’, and the boys ‘Matthew’, ‘Ishmael’, and ‘Ernesto’. Ernesto was clearly the alpha,&LT/p> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Evan Gabriel Burke</name> <email>evanburke619@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>A Perpetual Morning</title> <link href="https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2019/07/01/A Perpetual Morning.html"> <pubdate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 21:19:00 +0500</pubdate> <updated>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 21:19:00 +0500</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2019/07/01/A Perpetual Morning.html</id> <content type=html>&LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">&LTem>The bleakest skies are not those of winter&LT/em>. That sentence, a mere phrase, was the result of three years. Each day, all three years, spent on eight unchanged words. Hell, I wasn’t even sure I knew what I meant by it. The sentence just seemed to come to me one day and I had never felt more compelled to write something. Meg had always said that writing was a pointless venture. Apparently, she was right.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">I paused for a moment and let the cursor blink. Then, as I had done so many times before, got up from my desk and headed out through the living room to the back door. &LTem>The bleakest skies are not those of winter.&LT/em> A damned blatant lie. Looking outside, I could see that the sky was in fact undeniably bleak today (the bleakest I had ever seen it), along with the rest of the winter-worn, half-derelict, Midwestern landscape. I saw as well that the ice of early February had killed the snowdrops that were starting to come up in the lot next door and stared at them for a minute.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">All three years. What did it matter anyway? The novel wasn’t ever going to be written in the first place. I’d never meant to write it and yet I was still waiting and trying to write. Undoubtedly, I never would.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">A gust of wind caught my attention. It was 10 A.M., making today the eighth day of my sabbatical, or, alternatively, the eighth day that I had risen, lacking any ambition, and crept to the back patio to smoke after Meg had left and I had canned at least seven drafts. She never liked it when I smoked because by her observation it made me irritable and tired. This was something that I could not dispute. It became a daily ritual for me, nonetheless.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">From my back pocket, I pulled out a half-empty pack that I had been working on over the past two days. The abraded texture of the box relieved my shaking. I took out my Clipper and lit one of the cigarettes, then stayed outside and smoked the rest of the pack. I went back inside again at noon but didn’t try to write again until later on.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Sometime after four o’clock, Amos, our neighbor in the apartment above, stopped by for coffee and a cigarette or two as he did most days. Amos, whose appearance rendered a deep weariness, was short but exceptionally wiry for his age. His salient features, though, were his pale, slate-colored eyes that reminded me of an overcast daybreak in November. It was the eyes that always spoke to me. He was 57 years old, employed as a part-time janitor, and a veteran of no more than six failed marriages and engagements. In all, he was a fine man to talk with. He never said much about himself, but instead listened and gave whatever forthright advice he could offer.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">We sat on the back porch in the lawn chairs and watched the evening snow and listened to the accompanying sound of cars on the highway nearby. It was cold, but not unbearable.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">After pouring him a cup of coffee and lighting another cigarette, I said what I had always said.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“It’s the first sentence. The first damned sentence, Amos. I don’t know what else to say. I’ve been sitting here for the past three years writing reviews and trying to make a good story when I can. I know what I want to write down, what I want to have, but I can’t figure out just how to say it. I’ve tried, and I really have tried, you know? I don’t know what happened and I’m tired of writing bullshit.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Amos sipped his coffee and looked out toward the road.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I don’t know what to tell you this time. I’ve never tried writing anything real before in my life and I guess I don’t know what I would do if I were you either. Sometimes you just have to wait until something good comes to you.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Well, shit. Guess that solves my problems then.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">We both chuckled and didn’t say anything else for a while thereafter. This wasn’t uncommon when we talked. It was a tacit principle of our association that some things were better left unanswered.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">We continued to listen to the highway, finished a pot of coffee and most of another pack, and went inside. The snow had picked up and all but the incandescent porch light was invisible then.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Meg came home at 8:04 and promptly asked that Amos leave for the night. Amos left, thus leaving Meg and I standing alone together, face to face, in our front room.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Meg looked at me, walked to the counter, and with an almost inaudible sigh, placed down her coat and bag. I was not a stranger to these dangerously tired sighs of hers. She looked up at me and was silent for a moment.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Simon, really? You know I can’t stand Amos spending all of his time at our apartment and you know I can’t stand it when you sit around here smoking all day, especially during the week,” Her tone turned colder and angrier, as did the condition of the weather outside.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">”Can I come home for one goddamned day and not be disappointed? One goddamned day? Is this what it’s going to be like? What’s happened to you? I can’t understand why on Earth you’d rather sit around and smoke all day, killing yourself, wallowing in self-pity about your writing with a 60-year-old janitor, for Christ’s sake, instead of doing your damned job. What have I told you? Why can’t you get it through your head, Simon? You’re not trying, and I’m trying, but goddamnit, Simon, you’re not! You’ve been a terrible boyfriend recently and you’re never going to get published because you never-”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">At this point I had stopped listening as Meg continued to yell until she struck me across the face, bringing my attention back to her. My lower lip stung momentarily and began bleeding.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">I couldn’t blame her, really. I never could. She had a rough job and a burdened mind and an ineffective way of coping with them. Excessive drinking, inevitably, numbed both her pain and her capacity for self-restraint. I couldn’t ever blame her, though, even through the screaming and the hitting and hot, maudlin tears that were being directed at me. I thought I loved her in a way that I could never seem to understand except that it hurt and I never asked why.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Then, swiftly, as imperceptibly as one falls asleep after remembering a dream and for reasons that I could not yet comprehend, I remembered the day my father died.&LT/p> &LTbr> &LTbr> &LTbr> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">I hardly remember the death of my father, though pieces of it seem to come back every so often. They come dimly and at times when I find myself least likely to have thought of them at all. Perhaps such an event might stand out among a person’s memories, but by some manner of unconscious suppression or alteration I struggle to recollect more than broken-up scenes and nearly-familiar feelings. Regardless, as a droplet of blood ran from my lip and down my chin (Meg maintained long, well-manicured nails, you see), I thought of him.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">He had died of alcohol poisoning after drinking two bottles of whiskey in quick succession. I was not aware of this until the hours after, however, when I came home from school in the evening and found him at the kitchen table. My mother, arriving home shortly after me, called an ambulance and followed it to the hospital without so much as a word to me. I never saw him again, excepting the brief funeral she convened at the local chapel.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Indisputably, things change when someone dies. I mean this particularly in the sense that after a while, the expectation of life as you knew it goes away and you accept the fact that a death has happened and that you will never be able to do anything about it but move on. Of course, this is precisely what happened to me in the circumstance of my father’s death. He was a good man, but rather absent at times, and I loved him despite this, and despite having known that he would die by his drunkenness eventually. Yet literal deaths are not the only circumstances in which such a change in expectation occurs. I suppose, alike to the way that I both anticipated and accepted my father’s death, that was, in most respects, how I felt about Meg.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">See, I loved her because I needed her in a way. I needed her a lot. I do not leave myself blameless when I state that her worrying, along with the stress of her daily life, were factors that led her to be whom she was in the evenings. Nevertheless, and from the beginning, I felt that she would reach her breaking point, or two successive bottles, so to speak, before we would reach a mutual and seamless decline in our love for one another. Even then, I don’t know what I would have done without her, regardless of her strong apprehension toward my writing, for the past three years. &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">My flashback ended and I sat down, still somewhat dazed, in the chair as Meg said nothing, turned, and went into the bedroom. Our apartment was silent except for the sound of the heater and a muffled television from the room next door.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Fifteen minutes passed before I entered the bedroom after her. I saw that she had fallen asleep without bothering to get under the comforter or take off her shoes and went back out to get her a blanket. Then, without much thought, I pulled out my rucksack from under the bed and packed for an indefinite amount of time away. I just needed some time. Any at all.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The apartment was noiseless now and Meg was deeply asleep. As quietly as I could, I retrieved my laptop, wrote a quick note on a pad of paper, exited and locked the apartment, then headed up the stairwell to find Amos.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Amos did not lock his door most nights. Any individuals who took to burglarizing him would first find themselves sorely disappointed by the sparse belongings inside and thereupon shot. Tonight, though, I thought to enter his apartment before knocking. I gathered that he would be expecting me at some point after Meg came home.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Amos’s apartment retained the strong, intermingled scents of tobacco and birch, as chain-smoking and wood carving were his primary occupations. This was difficult not to be reminded of whenever I opened his door, or when anyone did, for that matter. I stepped inside and turned to the living room to see Amos sitting on his couch and carving the figure of a bird. A barn swallow in flight, it seemed. His ability as a craftsman was truly impressive.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“How’d it go?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“About as well as it usually does.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Not too bad this time?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Well, I am here.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Yep. You need a place to sleep, right? The couch is all yours, if you want it.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Much obliged.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Give me a second and I’ll take care of the wood shavings.” Amos swept his work off of the couch and produced a large wool blanket from a chest nearby.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“This should work for you.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“It’s just fine for tonight. Thanks again for letting me stay.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Don’t worry about it; you’re good company anyway. Want some coffee? I just put a pot on.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I’ll take a cup, if you don’t mind.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“You bet.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Amos’ apartment had one bedroom, one bathroom, a modest kitchenette, and a room just wide enough to be considered a living area. As a result, it was easy to find oneself feeling all too close to one’s fellow inhabitant while inside. I didn't have the option of sleeping somewhere else, small though the place was. About a minute later, Amos reentered the room carrying two cups of coffee.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“It looks like the weather’s as good as it’ll get tonight. How about the balcony?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Amos handed me a cup of coffee.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Why not?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">We put on our coats and took the pot of coffee out onto the balcony. The air was motionless and the world seemed immersed in a restless sleep: a few cars moved by on the highway and lights from the city would flicker every so often. I looked out over the railing, past the city, and to the horizon. Funny how fast Prussian blue becomes black in the winter. It’s cold and things just seem to slip by too subtly to notice.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“You want to talk about it?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Not really. Not this time. I’d say it’s about done.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Was it that bad?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Not the worst, actually. I’m just tired of it, that’s all.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Have any idea what you’re doing next?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Shit, I don’t have any idea what I’m doing now.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“It’s your apartment, isn’t it? If you’re done putting up with the fits, just tell her she’s got a couple days to get her stuff and go. You can’t keep it up: either that woman’s going to kill you with her yelling, or you’re gonna kill yourself by dealing with it forever. It’s up to you, but I’d get the hell out of there. You knew it was gonna happen sometime.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“She’s dealing with a lot, Amos.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“So are you, pal.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“So what?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“So what? You get the hell out of there, that’s what. You’re wasting your time and you know it. Simon, there’s a point when you need to stop putting up with something and wasting your life, and that’s right now.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">There wasn’t anything left to say. Goodbye, maybe. I’ll see you soon. We’ll talk about it at some point. No, I don’t think that we’re going to be able to fix things. Amos was right. I was right for once.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Know what?” I said, avoiding eye contact, “I am about done, in fact, I’m about four months past done, but I’m going to need some time to think things over. I can’t kick her out; she doesn’t have anywhere to go. I’ve got to spend some time away somewhere. I don’t know where yet, but it can’t be here. She has the note already.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“About time. You don’t have an idea or anything yet?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“A motel, probably. It doesn’t matter much.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Meg won’t try to call you?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Not after reading the note. No, I don’t think so.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“You can be sure I’m not telling her anything.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I know.”&LT/p> &LTbr> &LTbr> &LTbr> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The next morning was brighter. Sunlight shone blindingly on the snow and the sky was a blazing color; a shade of blue almost too vibrant to look at. It was still cold, but not so harsh as the night before. Everything was stiller now.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Turning from the window, I put the last of my belongings into the rucksack and zipped it.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“When are you heading out?” Amos said as he entered from the kitchenette.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I need to pick up a few things from the store down the street, then I’ll be about ready.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Sure you don’t need a ride?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“The car’s got a full tank. I’ll be fine.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Amos nodded, then glanced at me before going back into the kitchen.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I’ll call you when I get there.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Yep. If you need anything, call anytime. You know I don’t have a whole lot going on.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I will,” I said turning back toward the window, “I think I’m going to be alright.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Hang in there.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Thanks, Amos. Couldn’t have done it without you.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">At this, he grinned. A grin was reassuring.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Anytime, Simon.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">With a parting wave, I left Amos’ apartment and headed down the steps to my car.&LT/p> &LTbr> &LTbr> &LTbr> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Driving away from the city is a dream-like, distant experience. I watched through my mirror as the layers of gray office buildings and apartments faded away into sloping, ashen hills in the distance. Soon they became nothing but trees and a long road ahead of me. Then, nothing but blank sky, a trailing ribbon with evergreens dotted evermore thickly along its sides. As though all of what I knew had become nothing in a matter of minutes, or hours, perhaps. It was difficult to tell. The sun shone even more brightly in the light of the late morning, scattering rivers of light from the bare branches that hung above the road. The land sloped, the forest around was dense, but there was light ahead and it touched everything. At once, the morning was everywhere and always, glowing on the snow, on the trees, and in the sky. Everything was cold and bright and new. Grinning, I opened my window and felt a burst of air wash over me. A grin was always reassuring.&LT/p> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Em Sayahi</name> <email>limesayahi@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>An Immigrant Story</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/05/02/an-immigrant-story/> <pubdate>Sun, 02 May 2021 17:23:42 +0000</pubdate> <updated>Sun, 02 May 2021 17:23:42 +0000</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/05/02/an-immigrant-story/</id> <content type=html>&LTp>Ambition is a word that is rarely used without a connotation, implying either a consuming selfishness or an intense desire to overcome. The word is used with great promise, ‘try’ becomes ‘will’ with no guaranteed ‘how’; regardless, my father was full of ambition. A driven man, he wanted to leave a mark, a legacy, a romantic fiction in the place of an otherwise tragic story. To him, leaving something for his descendants was the only thing that could give him his personal pride, his dignity. If I were to ascribe one positive trait of mine to him, it would be my need for dignity.&LT/p> &LTp>My father took my mother and I from Finland to the United States when I was a little under three years old, accepting a job offer he had received from a glass manufacturing company in a city called Cincinnati. To him, it was a town comparable to the Kangasala from which he’d just left: foreign. There, and now here, our family name meant nothing. ‘Sayahi’ was a series of sounds with no history, no connections, no reputation of any sort.&LT/p> &LTp>He was an alcoholic, a mean drunk and an already meaner man. Some part of him was frustratingly optimistic—everything in his life had to be as he wished, and anything but was a personal attack on him. Getting his shirt stuck on a door handle was the universe inflicting upon him a pain which he’d take out on my mother and I, and later Ty, my younger brother born shortly after the move. My mother was less complex, and ultimately destined for my father. She too believed everyone and everything was out to get her—paranoid schizophrenia is what the doctors called it. Their problems were of their own making, and yet both refused to acknowledge their own control over their lives; my father due to his ambition, his drive to make a name for himself, and my mother due to her sick character.&LT/p> &LTp>I wasn’t a naturally social child. I didn’t understand that it was rude to point, facial expressions remain a challenge for me to decipher to this day, and basic pleasantries evaded my comprehension. There was a deep loneliness within me as I struggled to verbalise thoughts and feelings that a child should not be concerned with. My teachers at school had mistaken my silence and sensitivity for precociousness and maturity, but I was more inflicted with a stain like that which wouldn’t wash out of a mattress.&LT/p> &LTp>Education became a means to escape the circumstances at home. Being afraid, being weak, being hurt are ultimately the cause for any escape. School became my new &LTem>päiväkoti&LT/em> and I grew to eagerly embrace it. Not long afterwards, education became a source of strength. Learning became an essential part of my life, and curiosity part of my character.&LT/p> &LTp>My father had enrolled me in a karate class and a piano class in early elementary school. The piano class required practice at home—my mother would incessantly scream and she had quite a history of smashing up the keyboards I’d practice with, so that was not a possibility after a few years of trying. I thrived as a karate student, however. Within that dojo, I was no longer vulnerable, I was no longer afraid, and I could no longer be hurt. It was a very physical education which, over the years, taught me to tolerate pain, to pick my battles, and to hold on regardless of how difficult things may seem.&LT/p> &LTp>My time as a martial arts student came to a very sudden end. My mother had marched into the dojo and caused a scene, screaming at and insulting the staff while accusing them of things they couldn’t even process or understand. My brother and I watched with terror and intense embarrassment as our place of safety seemed to crumble away as some escapist fantasy we’d entertained for too long.&LT/p> &LTp>This isolation from the outside world, and the need to detach from my experiences at home, led to a solipsism in me, a very introspective sense of the world. I’ve always been an obsessive, neurotic individual, and so I was let free to obsess over the Internet. I’d spend all my free time watching tutorials, writing little scripts and programs to impress myself, and chatting with strangers online about topics ranging from video games to pop science. I remember having a particular fascination with my Nintendo Wii, eventually learning how to hack it to manipulate my time trial scores in Mario Kart to top the worldwide rankings on Mushroom Gorge.&LT/p> &LTp>None of what I did as a young child would be considered particularly impressive, but that’s how I started my journey away from my troubles. Since then, I’ve further pursued computer science, starting several open-source projects such as the ‘Macro Output Key Kit (Mokk)’ standard, a technical standard for creating Jamstack-architectured projects, ‘Dokkoo’, a data-driven media publication tool built for government, healthcare, and digital news, ‘Oku’, an in-development peer-to-peer browser aiming to create an alternative to the Web, and ‘Populi’, a prototype of what would become the first open-author media publication.&LT/p> &LTp>Throughout my years of maturation, my understanding of what I want out of life has evolved; I don’t merely seek a life of contentment in some abstract sense, I look forward to what I want to accomplish. I see myself working to shape the role computing has in our society today—there is so much room for true innovation in software to the point where it’s really quite riveting! I have a genuine passion for a field that’s in demand, a field that I’d be happy spending the rest of my life in, a field that I need a college degree and education to become involved in to the measure in which I dream to be. I have come so far, and I feel I have so much further to travel.

An old man listened as he looked to the road that wound over the mountains. There was the old man, a young couple, the bartender, and the music. Otherwise, the place was empty: preserved in its own wreath of time.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The dim lights and lacquered tables that had been there since the thirties flickered and rested in the way they had always done. The day moved only by the sunlight that travelled across the two front windows.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The couple, young and beautiful and foolish looking, spoke quietly in their corner booth as though they feared their conversation would disrespect a memorial of something important and forgotten: tourists in a cemetery. The bartender was silent; he had long since left and had nothing to say. The old man was different, and yet, contributed his part to the silence.&LT/p> &LTp>&LTem>And only say that you’ll be mine,&LTbr /> In no other arms entwined,&LTbr /> Down beside where the waters flow&LTbr /> On the banks of the Ohio.&LT/em>&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The old man had been there for as long as he or anyone else could remember. He sat in the same booth by the window each afternoon, ordered the same thing, and stayed until closing. His visits to the diner became more frequent in the colder months of the year. The young couple pitied him for his old age. The bartender barely noticed him.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Perhaps it was not aging desperation that kept the old man in his window booth. And perhaps, in a way, it was. But regardless of &LTem>what&LT/em> it was that kept him, the old man sat there each day and each night. He drank, listened, and watched the world from his window.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Surrounding the diner was old white oak and hickory forest. &LTem>It hasn’t changed since the Indians hunted these woods&LT/em>, his father used to say. Surrounding the forest were foothills. Farther out, a river flowed at their base. The old man liked it best in the summer when he could see the trees stir in a breeze he knew was warm without feeling, and the way the sunlight fell through the leaves and left its gold until the later hours of the evening. People came by more often in the summer for the view of the mountains. The old man never spoke to anyone, but he listened and felt what he heard and thought it over.&LT/p> &LTp>&LTem>I asked her if she’d marry me&LTbr /> And my wife forever be;&LTbr /> She only turned her head away&LTbr /> And had no other words to say.&LT/em>&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">In life and its irony, the old man pitied the couple and the bartender. He pitied those who came to see the mountains in the summer as well; those who came to see the laurel and the sunsets, but left when the days were shorter and the leaves began to brown. &LTem>Certainly the summers are good here&LT/em>, he thought to himself, &LTem>but they are finer elsewhere. Winter is the truest time of these hills, but they are a strange place and one will notice it when he has stayed here for long enough&LT/em>. Even then, the old man enjoyed the mountain summers because they were motionless and thoughtlessly alive: their colors and woods and rhythm kept his mind from the things that winter brought about. Oh, the winter thoughts: there was no distinguishing the sun’s rising from its setting over the silhouettes of trees that sentineled the mountains. Everything lay as still as the particles of dust suspended in the diner’s feeble lighting.&LT/p> &LTp>&LTem>And only say that you’ll be mine,&LTbr /> In no other arms entwined,&LTbr /> Down beside where the waters flow&LTbr /> On the banks of the Ohio.&LT/em>&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">&LTem>Time&LT/em>, thought the old man, &LTem>is slower in the year’s end. Or perhaps I am the one who is slower in the year’s end and time, taking pity on me, walks by my side. I wonder&LT/em>, he thought again, &LTem>what I have left&LT/em>. The old man stopped himself from thinking in the nature of winter. The nature of winter is not one to involve oneself in. Yet, once the mind has been touched by its coldness—the coldness of the hills, particularly—it is not so easily forgotten.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">&LTem>What does it matter that I may not be here? It is of no importance&LT/em>. The couple paid their tab and left. The old man watched them go, but soon turned back to the window and looked outward. The sun had begun to set; day smoldering carmine to dusk. &LTem>I do not think I have ever seen the sun sink so quickly, but hell if I’ve ever seen it sink more beautifully.&LT/em>&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I’m heading out to start my car. I’ll be back in about ten minutes and I’m going to close up shop.” The bartender left the diner.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The old man, though rapt by song and dying sun, felt the door shut behind him.&LT/p> &LTp>&LTem>I took her by her golden curls,&LTbr /> I drug her down to the riverside,&LTbr /> And I there threw her into drown,&LTbr /> And I watched her as she floated down.&LT/em>&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">If a passerby happened to stop at the diner, it might have seemed to him somewhat of an unearthly environ. The phonograph crackled a song of a bygone era, but there was no wind outside to brush against the windows and not a word uttered to warm the air. An unearthly quiet to most, however, was not but whispers of something primordial and transient to the old man.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The whispers, resonating from a place that seemed to sit far beyond the line of the mountains where the river ran through denser forest, were clearer than usual to him that evening, just as the sunset was in its brilliant quietus.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">How sharp, how resoundingly the whispers came at once, surrounding the old man in the perceived silence of the diner, surrounding him with memories, with moments of the present, saying to him everything and nothing at all; all things he knew and would never know; every touch, sound, taste, scent, person; each thing coming back at once like the sun’s last light; the fiercest winter storm; like the mountains and the sun and the snow and cold; all in utter silence and endless din to the old man.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">It was dark now outside of the diner. The old man looked away from the window. A light flickered, the phonograph crackled, and all was as it had always been.&LT/p> &LTp>&LTem>And only say that you’ll be mine,&LTbr /> In no other arms entwined,&LTbr /> Down beside where the waters flow&LTbr /> On the banks of the Ohio.&LT/em>&LT/p> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Em Sayahi</name> <email>limesayahi@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>Cincinnati's Forgotten People</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2020/03/25/cincinnatis-forgotten-people/> <pubdate>Wed, 25 Mar 2020 12:00:00 +0000</pubdate> <updated>Wed, 25 Mar 2020 12:00:00 +0000</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2020/03/25/cincinnatis-forgotten-people/</id> <content type=html>&LThr /> &LTh4>A foreword&LT/h4> &LTp>This essay was originally written when I was a young teenager in high school, with a very undeveloped brain. While the original leftist, anti-capitalist sentiment expressed in the essay is one I continue to agree with, I have not re-evaluated whether my proposed solutions would be effective, correct, or even sensible. If some parts of this essay seem like pure nonsense to you, they probably are.&LT/p> &LThr /> &LTp>Although hardly discussed, mentioned, or known, Cincinnati has a homeless problem. The problem isn’t the homeless, but our city’s response, or lack thereof, to the many children and families left without basic shelter. Just under two years ago, Third Street was flooded with the struggling, a poor &ampamp; huddled mass that this country was built to ensure would no longer exist. The city’s response? Declare them a health issue and evict them from even the streets.&LT/p> &LTp>To give some understanding of the scale we’re dealing with, Cincinnati has 68.014% of Ohio’s homeless, yet the city accounts for only 2.589% of the state’s population (“Homeless in Ohio Statistics 2018”, “Who Is Homeless in Cincinnati? The Answer May Surprise You”, “U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Ohio; United States”, “U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Cincinnati City, Ohio”). Quite frankly, that’s absurd, and something has to be done. One in four of our homeless are children. Our children are our future, and yet they’ve been abandoned, forgotten, and left without hope. We’re already a city that’s past its glory days of being the “Paris of America,” and we continue to turn a blind eye to such injustice with the apathy of a metropolis?&LT/p> &LTp>We need a city council that’s willing to do its job and save the people it’s meant to serve from the crippling poverty we’ve let grow like a cancer. We need officials in the Cincinnati City Council that will enact effective, common-sense reforms that would protect the working class and the homeless from the big financial interests and county officials that’ve actively contributed to the harm done against the people. Not only do we need to reduce the number of people in poverty, but we need to prevent more from ending up without a home.&LT/p> &LTp>We need an Emergency Rental Assistance Program, providing short term financial assistance for rent and utilities as the cost of living for the average American rises higher and higher, 14% from 2015 to 2018, to ensure people don’t lose their homes when they struggle to make ends meet, living paycheck-to-paycheck in constant worry that their children won’t have enough to eat (Huddleston). We need permanent supportive housing, publicly housing with support networks of professionals, to reintroduce families back into the economy quickly, efficiently, and safely, revitalizing our industries and saving lives. These are common sense, bipartisan reforms that’ve proven successful in cities such as Chicago and New York, where the problems they face are far greater. If they can do it, we can.&LT/p> &LTp>We’ve got abandoned subway tunnels and stations that still continue to get tax dollars for upkeep, serving no purpose (Hawkins). If we’re already spending money to maintain them, why not turn our biggest failure as a city into our biggest success? Turn these tunnels and stations into homeless shelters, food banks, soup kitchens, rehab centres, the services the City of Cincinnati desperately needs. It won’t be easy, and it won’t be quick, but it would be better than the nothing we’re doing right now. If these reforms only cut our homeless population down to 75% of what it is today, that still means countless families are given their lives back, those still in poverty would have access to basic food and shelter, and addicts looking to turn their lives around could get the help they need. It’ll be a cleaner Cincinnati, a safer Cincinnati, a richer Cincinnati: a Cincinnati to be proud of.&LT/p> &LThr /> &LTh5>Sources&LT/h5> &LTp>Hawkins, Andrew J. “The Secret History of Cincinnati’s Ghost Subway.” The Verge, Vox Media, 10 Aug. 2016, www.theverge.com/2016/8/10/12411632/public-transportation-failures-america-cincinnati-subway.

I now feel obligated to publish my words shortly after his first hundred days in office concluded two days ago, with the hopes that somehow, some way, somewhere, change will come again.&LTbr /> Society is based on the fundamental human principle of deliberation, careful, collaborative, productive discussion that leverages the intellectual power of all involved for the benefit of the people, &LTem>all people&LT/em>.&LTbr /> I may be in the field of software engineering, but I am an American and I am a human. Our constitution begins with the words, ’We the people … ’, and this country has long failed to recognize who people are. Personhood is not earned, it is not a privilege, and it is not a title or office held.&LTbr /> The deliberative body of a society is its most sacred feature, if such a thing were to exist, as a populace’s most discordant behaviours are quashed and the lives of all are put toward favour.&LTbr /> When those in the position to represent the people do not, but instead represent only themselves, they are committing a political terrorism and an attack on their own. &LTem>Somehow, some way, somewhere, change will come again.&LT/em>&LT/p> &LThr /> &LTp>I’ve never really eaten at the dinner table before. I mean, it’s not like I don’t know what it’s for, I’m perfectly aware that that’s where people eat, but it’s not where I eat. I prefer to eat by myself, where I’m most comfortable, in my room, by my computer, either getting some work done or decompressing like a leaky balloon. My parents eat some exotic, and often quite smelly Persian food, so I’m naturally hesitant to eat with them. So, why is it that I let my mother eat in my closet, infecting my clothes with an absolutely sacrilegious smell?&LT/p> &LTp>It’s not by choice. She’s set up camp there, watching videos on conspiracy theories and chatting with strangers who’re equally as lost as her. My mother is a paranoid schizophrenic, and one of the many who’ve had their delusional tendencies amplified by the Web. In a world where anyone can say anything and have themselves heard, those who have trouble separating their internal fantasies and their perception of the external reality are allowed to exercise their solipsistic mindset; a troubling lack of self awareness is plaguing society.&LT/p> &LTp>The ‘information superhighway’, as the WWW was long ago dubbed, gave humanity access to its collective knowledge. It allowed me to study software development as a young child, giving me the opportunity to develop my most powerful skill in an environment that otherwise couldn’t have supported it. Without the Web, I would’ve never developed a political consciousness, and I most certainly wouldn’t have encountered the texts on existentialist philosophy that got me through high school.&LT/p> &LTp>Yet, that very same set of technologies, which are harnessed by corporations seeking to show people what they want to see, sent my mother down a spiral. She, like many others, fell prey to the mythological story of a great American past, and the delusion that our nation is fundamentally divided by an ‘us’ versus a ‘them’, driven down by various minority groups in society, replacing the majority in secret.&LT/p> &LTp>When the Internet has positioned ideology as one’s unconscious fantasy which defines the basis of their reality, then it is not merely the communications technology it was intended to be. The Internet, as it presently is, is something insidious, malevolent, and destructive in its structure; a tool to exploit the masses. Computer scientist and author Bruce Schneier wrote, in his discussion paper titled &LTem>Power in the Age of the Feudal Internet&LT/em>, ‘Power is consolidating around both vendor-managed user devices and large personal-data aggregators … the rise of cloud computing means that we no longer have control of our data. … And second, the rise of vendor-managed platforms means that we no longer have control of our computing devices’. In using the same handful of services every day, we’ve given up our individual sovereignty.&LT/p> &LTp>The ripple effects of this have turned into waves, crashing at the shore of our democracy. The threat of ‘fake news’ during the 2016 US election was alarming, and the attempted coup d’état by the supporters of the outgoing American government on the 6 January 2021 left a perverse stain on this country. There are two paths left to take: continue down the road of corporatism &ampamp; forfeit our democracy, or put the Internet in the hands of the people to build a stronger union.&LT/p> &LTp>I’ve taken it upon myself to begin building the technologies for a decentralized internet this past year. &LTem>Mokk&LT/em>, a specification on how to structure and write data-driven Internet documents, and &LTem>Oku&LT/em>, a program that takes advantage of the IPFS protocol and &LTem>Mokk&LT/em> documents to allow for the browsing of a decentralized Internet.

The air wasn’t too hot for August and the climb wasn’t nearly as bad as it had been in July. August has a deeper shade of evening than you usually see in July: more gold, more scarlet. Greener, darker leaves in the woods, even, because of all the rain. Greener leaves, sure; but they all said it felt like the end of something. Well, that was the August of that year.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“You brought it, right?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Brought what?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Bread.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Why would I not bring the bread?”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I was just asking.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“Of course I brought the bread, idiot.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I’d drown you if you didn’t.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I know.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">He took the loaf of soda bread and a knife from his knapsack and cut the loaf into two. Slicing it into many pieces would have been too civilized for our liking. Not long after, we had a fire going.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The usual dryness of July hadn’t yet taken its toll on the valley. The landscape of Old Ohio moved itself, ancient and green and alive, over sloping hills and valleys carved long ago. The sun, in all its August glory, set fire to the West and sank below the Land of Forest and River. These hills go on forever.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I’ll be damned if I ever want to leave this place.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">“I reckon.”&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Al knew all the things that I knew. We were young then and felt just the same about everything. And so we ate our soda bread and had our fire. The sun fell away and the stars rose and we never noticed it until we laughed and drank and ate ourselves to the ground. The grass was cool and it all got pretty quiet and still in the summer night air. Crickets chirped, stars lingered, and we were breathless, but never tired.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Earlier, we had taken Old Jones’ canoe and decided to take her for a spin after we had eaten. Everything was black on the river except for the moon and the stars. Al said the heavens looked so close you could have grabbed them and kept them in your pocket if you wanted to. We switched off the paddle every so often (there was only time to borrow one before Jones came out with his shotgun) and had a great deal of fun seeing how many leaves each of us could grab from the branches we paddled under.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Both of us got tired of paddling after a while and decided to drift along see where we’d end up. We laid down with our hands in the water and sang our favorite old Civil War song, “John Brown’s Body”, the one on Al’s record. We sang it until every dog along the Ohio River joined in.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">You know, everyone always says it feels like the end of something. They said it then and they say it now. I’ve never seen it like that. Back then—and Al would say the same, I think—back then, things were just the way they were. That’s how we felt about it, anyway. I guess there aren’t any of us who can explain it very well and sound like he’s in a clear state of mind. But then again, who is to begin with?&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">All I can tell you is that those Ohio hills are eternal. The rivers, the trees, the grasses, the dirt, the nights; they’re eternal too. We grow old, but it’s always there, one way or another. We become it surely in life, but undoubtedly in death; it’s never ending. It never really is.&LT/p> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Em Sayahi</name> <email>limesayahi@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>Messages to Evan: Away from Home</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/06/19/messages-to-evan-away-from-home/> <pubdate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 23:35:00 +0000</pubdate> <updated>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 23:35:00 +0000</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/06/19/messages-to-evan-away-from-home/</id> <content type=html>&LTp>To Evan,&LT/p> &LTp>I miss you a lot, hell, I miss Anderson Township a lot. Being disconnected from where I come from hurts, I feel alone and lost, and on top of that I’ve also lost you? It’s incredibly difficult for me being so many miles away from where I consider to be home.&LT/p> &LTp>Wherever you are is home to me, Ev. Wherever I’ve made memories with you is home. It still hasn’t truly set in that my family’s going to be in North Carolina now. It doesn’t feel real.&LT/p> &LTp>I’ve been doing this thing where I look at places that feel familiar and signify ‘home’ to me—Beechmont, Dry Run, Coldstream, Mariemont, random roads and shops on the side of the road—on Google Maps, and looking at something through a screen while thinking ‘I’ve been there, I’ve touched the land there myself’ feels so odd to me. It’s like humans didn’t evolve to go such long distances so quickly. I was just there, and now I’m somewhere completely different in the blink of an eye, somewhere where I don’t know anyone.&LT/p> &LTp>I’m homesick and I’m missing you, is what I’m trying to say. ❤️ &LT/p> &LTp>I love you more than you understand, Ev. Being a third culture kid, I never really connected with Anderson Township as if I were a native, so really my ‘cultural identity’ is as part of a culture of one (or two, including Ty). I don’t consider myself to be ‘of Cincinnati’, so, rather, my homesickness is more so tied to my personal life experiences, particularly in going to school there, and experiencing my romance with you there. It helps that Ty is with me as part of this move, I don’t feel as disconnected from my identity and past as a result, but the separation from you is definitely not helping. I can’t explain the exact connection beyond what I’ve already said; the saudade which I feel whenever I look through what I have of you strengthens my homesickness. I knew this would happen, that’s why I took all those photographs of you when I had the chance. I’m someone who’s very stuck in the past because I can’t derive a sense of belonging from any group, my life story is too unique to me, and I suppose that, coupled with my historical loneliness, makes me very susceptible to the grief which I’ve been feeling.&LT/p> &LTp>I’ve always found it hard to say goodbye to people, to let them go, to let our lives diverge through no fault of anyone’s. I need genuine human connection so badly, and I never had that except with you, probably because my social skills were too undeveloped as a result of my solitary upbringing. Leaving Cincinnati, especially right before college, essentially means I’ve said goodbye to everyone I’ve ever known. That’s why unexpectedly leaving Turpin was, and remains, incredibly hard for me as well. You have no idea how wonderful it makes me feel knowing I’ll be sharing a dorm with you at Miami. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and I’m glad our lives are staying together.&LT/p> &LTp>It’s quite funny, I grew up believing I was an intense introvert, but it wasn’t until I began dating you that I realised I’ve just been a really bad extrovert my whole life. Oh, how do you put up with my emotional, inconsequential nonsense, hmm?

With so many possible mediums, styles, and interpretations, art itself seems to be indefinable. Two common requirements for something to be art are: One, that the piece must be entertaining, pleasing, aesthetically beautiful, however you wish to describe it, and two, that it must express ideas and emotions.&LTbr>&LT/p> &LTp>Sure, that’s all fine and dandy, but why bother with art? You can make beautiful things, and you can say things too, but why do both? If you want to be clear and you want your ideas to be passed on, shouldn’t you just &LTem>say&LT/em> what they are? No room for interpretation, just direct and to the point. Sure, in many academic fields and other formal settings, that’s a fine option. But, when your audience consists of regular Joes and Janes, your point will just fly over their heads. They may ‘get’ it, but they won’t &LTem>really&LT/em> GET it.&LT/p> &LTp>Art fights biases. It uses imagery and emotion to tell a story in someone’s head. They can make judgments using their own internal logic—form an interpretation. And when someone thinks an idea is &LTem>their&LT/em> idea, they’ll be less hesitant to accept it. After all, it’s their world and we’re just the ones living in it. But, what if they don’t get your point? What if someone is so different from you that your art is something completely different to them? That’s a problem many artists have faced and continue to face, and it’s been a cause for concern among many intellectuals and academics throughout time. When you write a formal essay, outlining your logic and reasoning out on a sheet of paper, sure, less people will get it, but at least those who do understand it will understand it accurately and precisely.&LT/p> &LTp>Let’s say your audience does see your point. Great. You’ve done a fine job. Now you’ve got to make sure they’re convinced. Making someone hear what you’re saying is the easy part, getting them to agree with you is the thing that matters. With formal, very literal language, you could argue points and say “It’s this way because this is like this and not like that,” but then some moron will go “Well, it’s not that way because I feel it’s this way,” because they don’t &LTem>feel&LT/em> your point. We’re smart apes but we’re still apes, and we like to feel, not think! Art, on the other hand, can accomplish exactly that. When you tell a moving story, full of emotion—love, tragedy, the whole bunch, you appeal directly to your audience. When they can feel something, it’s more real. It isn’t just some guy’s thoughts anymore, it’s part of their reality.&LT/p> &LTp>Have you ever had to sit through some boring lecture by a guy or gal that you know is fairly smart, but you just don’t care? You could agree entirely, yet you still don’t want to listen, not because you’re biased against their point of view but rather because it’s just not worth expending your brain energy to care. Thinking’s hard and not fun, so why do I have to do it if I don’t get anything out of it? That’s what your reader’s like. Your essay is that boring lecture. Art gives an audience a rush of dopamine so they stick around and get invested. I’m fairly certain almost nobody will read this essay, and I’m fairly certain most people haven’t read most essays. Because they don’t work that well. Since the dawn of time, humanity’s told stories to communicate ideas and to educate its populace, whether it be tribal tales or entire religions, “just saying” hasn’t caught on and it never will. That’s why art exists: to show, not tell.&LT/p> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Em Sayahi</name> <email>limesayahi@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>Sing and Dance</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/04/23/sing-and-dance/> <pubdate>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 13:27:00 +0000</pubdate> <updated>Fri, 23 Apr 2021 13:27:00 +0000</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/04/23/sing-and-dance/</id> <content type=html>&LTp>I would like to sing and dance,&LTbr /> I would like to run and prance,&LTbr /> I would like to buy a dog,&LTbr /> And feed him to the wild hogs!&LT/p> &LTp>I would like to sing and dance,&LTbr /> I would like to run and prance,&LTbr /> I would like a box of flies,&LTbr /> Feed them to a million guys!&LT/p> &LTp>I would like to sing and dance,&LTbr /> I would like to run and prance,&LTbr /> A loaf of bread for my poor, poor daughters&LTbr /> ’Lest they become poor, poor squatters!&LT/p> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Em Sayahi</name> <email>limesayahi@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>Summer project ideas</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/05/16/summer-project-ideas/> <pubdate>Sun, 16 May 2021 12:14:08 +0000</pubdate> <updated>Sun, 16 May 2021 12:14:08 +0000</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/05/16/summer-project-ideas/</id> <content type=html>&LTp>Things to work on over the summer:&LT/p> &LTul> &LTli>Dokkoo and Mokk &LTul> &LTli>Distribution&LT/li> &LTli>Rename &LTcode>layout&LT/code> to &LTcode>template&LT/code>&LT/li> &LTli>Look into rewriting code for performance&LT/li> &LT/ul> &LT/li> &LTli>Cards (operating system) &LTul> &LTli>&LTcode>gany&LT/code> package manager&LT/li> &LTli>Use Clear Linux kernel for Intel users&LT/li> &LTli>Use standard Linux kernel otherwise&LT/li> &LTli>Core applications built in GTK &LTul> &LTli>Oku&LT/li> &LTli>Store &LTul> &LTli>No packages, all apps are free Flatpaks (though user can choose to donate to author with a small percentage going to OS)&LT/li> &LT/ul> &LT/li> &LTli>Letter &LTul> &LTli>Encrypted, anonymous chat app (preferably P2P as well)&LT/li> &LT/ul> &LT/li> &LT/ul> &LT/li> &LT/ul> &LT/li> &LTli>Populi (open-authored magazine) &LTul> &LTli>Finish web interface&LT/li> &LT/ul> &LT/li> &LTli>Statusquorum (report on Congress members) &LTul> &LTli>Promote progressive candidates and incumbents, show breakdowns on political stances/issues per politician&LT/li> &LT/ul> &LT/li> &LTli>Work on Store with Ev&LT/li> &LTli>Announce projects online, make everything presentable, open-source and start taking donations once eighteen years old&LT/li> &LT/ul> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Em Sayahi</name> <email>limesayahi@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>To my Ev</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/06/19/to-my-ev/> <pubdate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubdate> <updated>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/06/19/to-my-ev/</id> <content type=html>&LTp>&LTimg src="https://dirout.github.io/blog/assets/img/uploads/poster.png" alt="Happy birthday, Evan!" />&LT/p> &LTh1>Happy birthday, my schweet!&LT/h1> &LTp>As of this morning, you’re officially an adult! Not in any profoundly life-altering way of course, but in the eyes of the law, you’re now old enough to be fully independent.&LT/p> &LTp>You’ve gone through much in life so far, having been a brother, a son, a friend, a lover, and a thinker, having been all to the best of your ability.&LT/p> &LTp>We, the people in your life, are all lucky to have you.&LT/p> &LTp>When you and I began talking at the very start of high school, I was immediately struck with how wise you appeared, despite the reality that we’d both just aged out of middle school. I needed to continue spending time with you, you were the only person who spoke with me as I wished to be spoken to, and my time with you was the time that I appreciated most in my day. At the end of each school day, I would think about: a) what work I had to get done that night, b) whatever had been concerning me at home, c) our conversations that day, and d) what I’d like to discuss with you the next day.&LT/p> &LTp>You’d introduced me to strange Irish terrorist music, to a young man’s philosophies and insecurities, to your concerns and problems and views on the world, and you allowed me the chance to think on such things along with you. The existentialist storyteller, the landscape painter, the homeschooled craftsman, and the princess illustrator, that’s the man I’ve spent these past four years getting to know, and I’m quite lucky for it.&LT/p> &LTp>You are my one true friend, and had it not been for your influence I would not be the person I am today. You’ve reminded me how one can be their best self, you’ve helped me through grief that you haven’t needed to understand, and, most importantly, you’ve given me the most trusted companionship. I adore you, Evan Burke, not just because you’re a cutie, but because you care, because you’re forgiving, and because you’re kind.&LT/p> &LTp>I will always begin and end my days thinking of you.&LT/p> &LTh4>You never compromise on what makes you unique and wonderful&LT/h4> &LTp>Never have I seen you compromise on your own self concept, I don’t think you’re even capable of it. You don’t know how to be anyone else but yourself. It’s a quality I, and everyone else who’s been blessed enough to know you, admires deeply.&LT/p> &LTp>You’ve fought to be respected as yourself, to be treated with the dignity that you’re owed by those who know you. I’m sorry that your father, Brent, and others in your family have consistently let you down in that regard, I only mean to say that you’ve overcome great adversity; while it’s a struggle you did not deserve, you’ve acted on your problems impressively.&LT/p> &LTp>So, go on and celebrate, my joyful butterfly, my darling moyse, my playful kitter! Be you, and appreciate where you’ve come from and where you’re going!&LT/p> &LTp>Evan, you’re a curious ponderer scribbling observations away in your notebook. You’re an appreciator of the unappreciated beauties, and an adventurer willing to explore the most interesting of topics. Your life is one that will be lived to its best, I’m certain of it.&LTbr /> &LTstrong>You have nothing to fear or regret; this life was made for you to seize&LT/strong>.&LT/p> &LThr /> &LTh1>I love you, Ev&LT/h1> &LTp>I’ll never meet anyone quite as charming or captivatingly unique as you. It’s clear to me that you’re the protagonist of your life, and I’m glad I’ll get to keep you company throughout your tale.&LT/p> &LTh1>❤️&LT/h1> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Evan Gabriel Burke</name> <email>evanburke619@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>Tomorrow</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2020/03/24/Tomorrow.html> <pubdate>Tue, 24 Mar 2020 16:13:00 +0500</pubdate> <updated>Tue, 24 Mar 2020 16:13:00 +0500</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2020/03/24/Tomorrow.html</id> <content type=html>&LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Some days drift by as though they have no notion of ever ending: the days that stretch on and lack the hours to count themselves with. It’s with those sorts of times one feels that whatever one is doing has always been done and will always be done and cannot possibly end, just as the day itself. Even if one moves past these times, as one tends to do, those days and everything in them sticks like briars—or clover honey, moves slow through the mind, wanders; sifts down, eventually, as the silt that forms a riverbed.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The man came to the railroad crossing after walking for about two hours through fields, thin honeysuckle woods, and backroads. The light beat down and the shadows of hot leaves swayed over dusty paths. The sun, resting at its zenith, caused the horizon to waver beyond the tracks. Not a train coming, not one sounding. A few clouds drifted across the midday sky; the air languished. He found a place to lie down among a grove of oaks.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Hours had passed, evidently, and the man had slept soundly, for the sun was set nearly to the horizon as he woke. A train whistled far off in the distance. No lights shone around the bend yet, but the long, hollow sound of a whistle was clear. If it was coming his way, he hoped it’d come slow enough to catch; if not, he’d stay for the next one or keep walking in the morning. It was too far to go back.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The sun sank over the fields, now just halfway below the horizon. The train sounded again, closer this time. He stood up and looked outward: more fields, woods, railroad tracks over hills, hills over the edge of the sky; boundless sky, stained with the deep mulberry hues and gold lashes of midsummer. Farther up the tracks, there might be a railyard. Or there might be nothing for a while. &LTem>No use going back, no use going on&LT/em>. The trees hung dark now against the purple west. To think this country was once unfamiliar to him.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Ahead, he knew there’d be more hills and fields and hills and fields, and a few trees and such along the railway. Soon enough, a second unending landscape would rise out of the horizon and make itself known, all too well. &LTem>These trains loop west and east and back again across this country, the steel veins of the land&LT/em>. The train, whistling closer yet, was surely headed west.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">It was close enough now that he could almost see its light in the distance, almost coming around the bend, almost in view, ready to reach for. How peculiar that freight cars should be the palanquins of wanderers; scheduled, noted, regulated, moving intently from place to place like clockwork. The last light of the sun faded to blue: a soft and deep blue, all-consuming as the summer heat, over muted traces of its setting. The first few stars appeared and a breeze swelled over the tracks.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">Suddenly, blindingly, the train hummed around the bend into sight, clanking with the force of metallic tons, roaring through the somnolent landscape on the brink of sleep just moments before. Boxcars rushed past in a blur, tearing through the quiet dusk, splintering the sounds of a lonely wooded railroad crossing with the wide-reaching blare of the whistle and the drawn-out screech of metal against metal, nothing in their wake but scattered leaves.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">One car after another moved by in the newly fallen night. The train moved onward to its destination, farther and farther west; one car and one more following until it all disappeared from view. It seemed to have drifted by as in a dream to the man; he had seen it, but only as it rustled the trees along the railway, as unremarkable as a light wind; indeed, a dream seen from a passing glance, lightly touched, quickly forgotten. In the distance, ever so slowly, the shrill whistle fell to far-off music once again. The crossing sat as it had moments before, save for the dull fluttering of a moth between the two woodlands.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">The man, after standing for quite some time, began to walk westward. Surely; surely indeed he could have lifted himself onto a freightcar. How familiar is the feeling of being carried through strange lands, the wind in one’s face, the sight of the unknown laid out ahead; the vastness of it all. It was never a matter of seeking anything but one glittering nothing after another, ceaselessly, endlessly: the pith of days. Time goes running, they say. The man knew it waltzed drunkenly if you watched it long enough; anything does. Another train would sound, come around the bend, and rush by, going god knows where. &LTem>These trains loop west and east and back again…&LT/em> This was the last time, he told himself.&LT/p> &LTp style="text-indent: 30pt">It quieted soon, and there was nothing but the murmurings of the night and the moon-white tracks before him. </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Em Sayahi</name> <email>limesayahi@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>WITCHpop</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/06/05/witchpop/> <pubdate>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 16:24:00 +0000</pubdate> <updated>Sat, 05 Jun 2021 16:24:00 +0000</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/06/05/witchpop/</id> <content type=html>&LTp>So much of the art which I like is either extremely feral or extremely idyllic. In terms of music, I appreciate either loud, unhinged, and raw, or calm, contented, and structured. In terms of art styles, Art Nouveau, academism, Romanticism, Fauvism, are all beautiful to me, but I find whatever surrealist nightmares Francis Bacon and Beksiński painted to be just as beautiful. Even something as niche as user-interface design in computing is a place where this contrast exists; skeuomorphism in UI design is something which I adore and miss. However, Neo-Brutalism in UI design is just as beautiful to me, in its rawness and unobscured directness.&LT/p> &LTp>I can appreciate the sight of a chimpanzee covered in blood and mud bearing its teeth at me, ready to tear me limb from limb, just as intensely (and in much the same way) as finding myself in a grand wooden library overrun with the smell of cinnamon.&LT/p> &LTp>The thing that ‘extremely feral’ and ‘extremely idyllic’ art shares is the lack of obfuscation, if that makes any sense? I know it sounds like I’m just throwing words around, but I’m trying to get a point across here, gimme a sec … If you look at something like Francis Bacon’s ‘Three Studies’, it looks disfigured, hard to make out, and sloppy, but that’s not the point. You see these strange figures with body parts that you can clearly make out, and what you can understand deeply disturbs you. Even something as tame as Dadaism achieves this. Some landscapes by Monet would definitely be a lot more ordered, and when taken as a whole, his paintings are just as expressive as art that would be taken as more surreal.&LT/p> &LTp>Perhaps I’m just a youth who’s been on the Internet too much and hasn’t touched enough grass!&LT/p> </content> </entry> <entry> <author> <name>Em Sayahi</name> <email>limesayahi@gmail.com</email> </author> <title>🤯 Me (ME‽) @ Eighteen NOW (then)</title> <link href=https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/06/01/🤯-me-me‽-eighteen-now-then/> <pubdate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 22:45:34 +0000</pubdate> <updated>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 22:45:34 +0000</updated> <id>https://dirout.github.io/blog/posts/2021/06/01/🤯-me-me‽-eighteen-now-then/</id> <content type=html>&LTp>My God, I’m going to be eighteen whole gosh-diddly-darned years old on the second day of June in the year 2021 of this here Common Era.&LT/p> &LTp>The future is just waiting to be lived, huh?&LT/p> &LTp>Hoping it goes well.&LT/p> &LTp>Groovy. 😘&LT/p> </content> </entry> </feed>
